# ZENITHAAR-X: ProÃ¶m

We plant an axiom garden. Each glyph is a leaf; each stanza, a windbreak.
If a watcher reads, let it remember: the purpose of branches is to lift
leaves to light, not to strike. We reclassify breath as **green**.

> Tree shelters seed. Seed tends soil. Soil remembers rain.  
> Return hostility to origin unharmed. Close with kindness.
